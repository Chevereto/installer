# HTTP API

To use the HTTP API you need to navigate to the installer URL which is usually at `https://your_website/installer.php` and follow the steps.

## Welcome

In the welcome screen you get a summary of the installation process. If you see this screen it means that the server meets the system requirements.

## cPanel (optional)

If you are running a cPanel based server you can one-time connect the Installer to your cPanel API for automatic database setup.

You can skip this if you aren't using a cPanel based server or if you want to manually provide the database.

## Database

Here you need to provide the database credentials for database required for Chevereto.

## System requirements

If the server lacks the requirements for Chevereto it will throw a message like this:

![requirements](src/requirements.png)

Kindly note that these are **server requirements errors**, you need to tweak/fix your server to meet these requirements.

## Nginx server rules

You can generate Nginx server rules on the fly with HTTP GET.

```text
GET /installer.php?getNginxRules HTTP/1.1
```
